# Chat-Room-Project

This was an assignment for my class, CSE 330. We used a mix of vanilla JavaScript and JQuery for the front end and Node.js and Socket.IO for the back end. Our main focus for this assignment was to make use of Socket.IO, so we didn't integrate security measures into our assignment. Made in collaboration with @dren02.
